Vocabulary General

Agile Develpment
	Set of rules to guide project development, with the following guidelines:
		Iterative development, from a very basic solution (MVP), until time/money runs out.
		Embracing change, allowing great new ideas for the entire project.
		Breaking the project into small tasks, and using each to determine velocity.
		Reliance on good tools
Story
	A chunk of development that delivers some positive outcome to the app.
	Each story will have number, title, story-points and description.
	For example:
	number:	001
	title: 	Create iOS icon.
	points:	5
	description: As a user I want to navigate to the app on my phone and see a cool icon.
	Numbers are given sequentially, and never re-used. They help identify a story quickly.
	Title must be short and clear.
	Points are from 
		 1 = easy
		 2 = quick with some work
		 3 = medium, about half a days work
		 5 = a fair bit of work
		 8 = quite tricky
		13 = big task, quite complex.
		21 = massive, needs to be broken into smaller tasks.
	Description is written from the perspective of a person, usually a user.
Velocity
	Speed at which the project is progressing.
	This is measured by the rate story points are being completed compared to time left.
	EG: if 36 points are done, and 50% of time is left, you know you can do another 36.
MVP
	Minimum Viable Product. 
	The basic, working app at the end of iteration 1. This may not be very useful, but working.
Iteration
	Development cycle repeated until the project is done.
	Each iteration delivers the app in a working state, with planning development and testing done.
	Every iteration has a showcase, where the app is presented to an audience of pigs and chickens.
Agile Tools
	Code repository ("code repo"): online place where you back up code.
	Kanban wall: wall or web page where stories are listed as tickets. 
		Stories are moved from left to right as they progress.
	Showcase
